# Issue

After installing Templater plugin and Modal Forms plugin, the Modal Forms plugin does not parse Templater syntax in the "Templates" tab when editing a single form.

You can try inserting the "character" form via a command in the Command Pallete inside `Unknown.md` and see that the Templater syntax does not run.
